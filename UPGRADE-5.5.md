### Custom file extension whitelist

Shopware by default only allows a fixed list of known file extensions to be uploaded to the server using the MediaManger. If you need to upload files with an extension not in this internal list, you can now add necessary file extensions in your `config.php`:

```php
<?php
return [
    ...
    'media' => [
        'whitelist' => [
            'docx',
            'xslx'
        ],
    ]
];
```

### Debug Elasticsearch Mapping

Shopware adds a `_source` to reduce the size of the indices by default. By setting the `debug` option to true, you can get every field back by Elasticsearch.

```php
<?php
return [
    ...
    'es' => [
        'debug' => true,
    ]
];
```

For security reasons, some extensions like php, cgi, com, exe are not allowed in the whitelist.

### Excluding URLs from sitemap and adding custom URLs

With Shopware 5.5.0, we added a better way to handle a lot of sitemap URLs. 
Unfortunately this way we also dropped the support for customizing the URLs being used in a sitemap.

With Shopware 5.5.7, we've reimplemented a way to deal with unwanted URLs, as well as a way to add custom URLs to your
generated sitemaps.

Just add the example configuration mentioned below into your `config.php` file.

```php
<?php
return [
    ...
    'sitemap' => [
        'excluded_urls' => [
            [
                // Possible resources:
                // - product (\Shopware\Models\Article\Article::class)
                // - campaign (\Shopware\Models\Emotion\Emotion::class)
                // - manufacturer (\Shopware\Models\Article\Supplier::class)
                // - blog (\Shopware\Models\Blog\Blog::class)
                // - category (\Shopware\Models\Category\Category::class)
                // - static (\Shopware\Models\Site\Site::class)
                'resource' => \Shopware\Models\Article\Article::class,

                // The ID for the entity mentioned above (e.g. 5 excludes the URL for the product with ID 5).
                // If left empty (or 0), the whole resource will be skipped for URL generation
                'identifier' => '',
                
                // The ID of the shop to which this exclusion applies. If left empty (or 0), this applies for every shop
                'shopId' => 0
            ]
        ],
        'custom_urls' => [
            [
                // The custom URL
                'url' => 'https://myCustomUrl.de',

                // Date in format Y-m-d H:i:s
                'lastMod' => '2019-01-01 00:00:00',

                // How frequently the page is likely to change
                // Possible values: always, hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, yearly, always
                'changeFreq' => 'weekly',

                // The priority of this URL relative to other URLs on your site
                // Must be a value between 0 and 1
                'priority' => 0.5,

                // The ID for the shop to which this custom URL applies. If left empty (or 0), this applies for every shop
                'shopId' => 2,
            ]
        ]
    ]
];
```

* Deprecated the unspecific request params assignment to view in `\Shopware_Controllers_Widgets_Listing::productsAction` and `\Shopware_Controllers_Widgets_Listing::streamAction`. Use a *PostDispatchEvent to assign necessary variables in a plugin. The assignment will be removed in 5.6

### Removals

* Removed unused `Shopware.data.ClassCache` ExtJs class

### Changed occurences of snippets embedded in strings

Wherever a snippet's content was embedded inside a string, it's value now gets assigned to a variable instead. This may lead to broken links or text, in case a snippet contains escaped quotemarks (`\"`), since escaping them is not necessary anymore.

Please check all snippets with escaped quotation marks after upgrading.

### Defining Elasticsearch version to reduce calls

By default, Shopware makes an `info` request to the Elasticsearch backend to be able to determine the version of Elasticsearch that is being used. In high load environments, this can create unnecessary additional load on all services due to the slight overhead these requests create.

Starting with Shopware 5.5.5, it is possible to define the version of Elasticsearch being used in the `config.php` like described below. Doing so will keep Shopware from making these `info` requests.

```php

<?php
return [
     ...
     'es' => [
         ...
         'version' => '5.6.5',
     ],
];
```

### Elasticsearch in backend

To activate elasticsearch in backend you have to enable the `es => backend => enabled` parameter in the `config.php` and start a indexation
of the backend entities with `sw:es:backend:index:populate`.

### MySQL 8 workaround

Due to a mixture of MySQL 8 and Doctrine constraints, the column `s_core_documents.ID` will be renamed to
`s_core_documents.id` on the fly if MySQL 8 is being used. To be able to do that, the service `\Shopware\Components\Compatibility\LegacyDocumentIdConverter`
was introduced, which is checked in the file `engine/Shopware/Models/Order/Document/Document.php` to determine if
a Doctrine model with uppercase or lowercase `id` needs to be used.

If you need to reference this column in your own model, we recommend to use the same workaround there. You can use the
same service (see above) with id `legacy_documentid_converter` for that.

The reason for this workaround is that MySQL 8 forces ids in foreign key constraints to be lower case.

This is a problem in current systems since we have an uppercase `ID` in table `s_order_documents`.
MySQL doesn't care if we use `ID` in the table and `id` in the constraint, but Doctrine needs both to be written 
in the same way. On new installations of Shopware 5.5 this is already the case, both are lowercase there.

So in order to support MySQL 8 on updates from older Shopware versions we need to change the case of the `id` column
in `s_order_documents`, which breaks support of blue/green deployments as older versions of Shopware (< 5.5) need
that column to be uppercase.

Since this change is only really necessary if you are using MySQL 8, it is only enforced when a MySQL 8 server is
detected. A downgrade to an older Shopware installation wouldn't be possible anyway in that case, as Shopware 5.4
does not support MySQL 8 yet.

If you want to make this migration offline, there is the command `sw:migrate:mysql8` to check if the migration was
executed and do so if you want.

The column `s_core_documents.id` will be lowercase from Shopware 5.6 forward.

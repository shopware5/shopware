### Smarty Rendering

#### Form Fields

Only variables that were previously assigned to the view are rendered. In addition, smarty function calls are no longer executed.

##### Example

```
{sElement.name} // works

{sElement.name|currency} // works, but does not execute the currency function

{sElement.value[$key]|currency} // does not work
```

#### Tracking Code

Smarty rendering has been disable for this section. All variables have been removed with one exception. The variable `{$offerPosition.trackingcode}` is a placeholder now. To generate tracking urls, use the following pattern:

```
https://gls-group.eu/DE/de/paketverfolgung?match={$offerPosition.trackingcode}

<a href="https://gls-group.eu/DE/de/paketverfolgung?match={$offerPosition.trackingcode}" onclick="return !window.open(this.href, 'popup', 'width=500,height=600,left=20,top=20');" target="_blank">{$offerPosition.trackingcode}</a>
```

### Attribute label translations

Translations for different fields (help, support, label) can be configured via snippets.

**Example: `s_articles_attributes.attr1`**

| Field | Snippet name |
|-------|--------------|
| Snippet namespace         |  backend/attribute_columns |
| Snippet name label        |  s_articles_attributes_attr1_label |
| Snippet name support text |  s_articles_attributes_attr1_supportText |
| Snippet name help text    |  s_articles_attributes_attr1_helpText |

### Backend Components

You can now define the expression for the comparison in SQL. For example `>=` like seen below:

```javascript
Ext.define('Shopware.apps.Vote.view.list.extensions.Filter', {
    extend: 'Shopware.listing.FilterPanel',
    alias:  'widget.vote-listing-filter-panel',
    configure: function() {
        return {
            controller: 'Vote',
            model: 'Shopware.apps.Vote.model.Vote',
            fields: {
                points: {
                    expression: '>=',
                }
            }
        };
    }
});
```

### Captcha

Captchas are now configurable via backend and can be added using the `shopware.captcha` dependency injection container tag.

```xml
<service id="shopware.captcha.recaptcha" class="SwagReCaptcha\ReCaptcha">
    <argument type="service" id="guzzle_http_client_factory"/>
    <argument type="service" id="config"/>
    <tag name="shopware.captcha"/>
</service>
```

For more information, please refer to our [Captcha Documentation](https://developers.shopware.com/developers-guide/implementing-your-own-captcha/).

### Redis backend and doctrine cache
Redis can now be used as a cache provider for the backend and model caches. Here is an example:

```
    'model' => [
        'redisHost' => '127.0.0.1',
        'redisPort' => 6379,
        'redisDbIndex' => 0,
        'cacheProvider' => 'redis',
    ],

    'cache' => [
        'backend' => 'redis',
        'backendOptions' => [
            'servers' => array(
                array(
                    'host' => '127.0.0.1',
                    'port' => 6379,
                    'dbindex' => 0,
                ),
            ),
        ],
    ],
```

### Select field replacement

The replacement of the select field elements via JavaScript is deprecated and will be removed in a future release. You can create a styled select field with a simple CSS-only solution by adding a wrapper element.

```
<div class="select-field">
    <select>
        <option></option>
        <option></option>
    </select>
</div>
```

### Batch Product Search

The Batch Product Search service works with request and results. You can add multiple criteria's and/or product numbers to a request and resolve them in an optimized way. An optimizer groups multiple equal criteria's into one and performs the search.

```php
$criteria = new Critera();
$criteria->addCondition(new CategoryCondition([3]));
$criteria->limit(3);

$anotherCriteria = new Critera();
$anotherCriteria->addCondition(new CategoryCondition([3]));
$anotherCriteria->limit(5);

$request = new BatchProductNumberSearchRequest();
$request->setProductNumbers('numbers-1', ['SW10004', 'SW10006']);
$request->setCriteria('criteria-1', $criteria);
$request->setCriteria('criteria-2', $anotherCriteria);

$result = $this->container->get('shopware_search.batch_product_search')->search($request, $context);

$result->get('numbers-1'); // ['SW10004' => ListProduct, 'SW10006' => ListProduct]
$result->get('criteria-1'); // ['SW10006' => ListProduct, 'SW10007' => ListProduct, 'SW10008' => ListProduct]
$result->get('criteria-2'); // ['SW10009' => ListProduct, 'SW10010' => ListProduct, 'SW10011' => ListProduct, 'SW10012' => ListProduct, 'SW10013' => ListProduct]
```

### Partial facets

`\Shopware\Bundle\SearchBundleDBAL\FacetHandlerInterface` marked as deprecated and replaced by `\Shopware\Bundle\SearchBundleDBAL\PartialFacetHandlerInterface`.
Each facet handler had to revert the provided criteria by their own to remove customer conditions. This behaviour is now handled in the `\Shopware\Bundle\SearchBundleDBAL\ProductNumberSearch::createFacets`

Old implementation:
```
/**
 * @param FacetInterface $facet
 * @param Criteria $criteria
 * @param ShopContextInterface $context
 * @return BooleanFacetResult
 */
public function generateFacet(
    FacetInterface $facet,
    Criteria $criteria,
    ShopContextInterface $context
) {
    $reverted = clone $criteria;
    $reverted->resetConditions();
    $reverted->resetSorting();

    $query = $this->queryBuilderFactory->createQuery($reverted, $context);
    //...
}
```

New implementation:
```
public function generatePartialFacet(
    FacetInterface $facet,
    Criteria $reverted,
    Criteria $criteria,
    ShopContextInterface $context
) {
    $query = $this->queryBuilderFactory->createQuery($reverted, $context);
    //...
```

#### Elastic search
In the elastic search implementation the current filter behavior is controlled by the condition handlers. By adding an query as `post filter`, facets are not affected by this filter.
This behavior is checked over the `Criteria->hasBaseCondition` statement:
```
/**
 * @inheritdoc
 */
public function handle(
    CriteriaPartInterface $criteriaPart,
    Criteria $criteria,
    Search $search,
    ShopContextInterface $context
) {
    if ($criteria->hasBaseCondition($criteriaPart->getName())) {
        $search->addFilter(new TermQuery('active', 1));
    } else {
        $search->addPostFilter(new TermQuery('active', 1));
    }
}

```
This behavior is now controlled in the `\Shopware\Bundle\SearchBundleES\ProductNumberSearch`. To support the new filter mode, each condition handler has to implement the `\Shopware\Bundle\SearchBundleES\PartialConditionHandlerInterface`.
It is possible to implement this interface beside the original `\Shopware\Bundle\SearchBundleES\HandlerInterface`.
```
namespace Shopware\Bundle\SearchBundleES;
if (!interface_exists('\Shopware\Bundle\SearchBundleES\PartialConditionHandlerInterface')) {
    interface PartialConditionHandlerInterface { }
}

namespace Shopware\SwagBonusSystem\Bundle\SearchBundleES;

class BonusConditionHandler implements HandlerInterface, PartialConditionHandlerInterface
{
    const ES_FIELD = 'attributes.bonus_system.has_bonus';

    public function supports(CriteriaPartInterface $criteriaPart)
    {
        return ($criteriaPart instanceof BonusCondition);
    }

    public function handleFilter(
        CriteriaPartInterface $criteriaPart,
        Criteria $criteria,
        Search $search,
        ShopContextInterface $context
    ) {
        $search->addFilter(
            new TermQuery(self::ES_FIELD, 1)
        );
    }


    public function handlePostFilter(
        CriteriaPartInterface $criteriaPart,
        Criteria $criteria,
        Search $search,
        ShopContextInterface $context
    ) {
        $search->addPostFilter(new TermQuery(self::ES_FIELD, 1));
    }

    public function handle(
        CriteriaPartInterface $criteriaPart,
        Criteria $criteria,
        Search $search,
        ShopContextInterface $context
    ) {
        if ($criteria->hasBaseCondition($criteriaPart->getName())) {
            $this->handleFilter($criteriaPart, $criteria, $search, $context);
        } else {
            $this->handlePostFilter($criteriaPart, $criteria, $search, $context);
        }
    }
}
```

### CookiePermission

Cookie permissions is now a part of shopware and you can configure it in the shop settings.

We implement a basic cookie permission hint. If you want to change the decision whether the item is displayed or not, overwrite the jQuery plugin in the `jquery.cookie-permission.js`.

### Shopping Worlds

Shopping World have been technically refactored from the ground up to improve the overall performance when adding several elements to a shopping world. It is now possible to export and import shopping worlds via the backend.
You can also convert shopping worlds to presets for reusability of configured shopping worlds. Please see Developer Docs article for further information.

#### ComponentHandler

The processing of elements has been changed from events to classes of component handler.

**Before: Subscribe to an event and process element data in the callback method**

```php
public static function getSubscribedEvents()
{
    return ['Shopware_Controllers_Widgets_Emotion_AddElement' => 'handleSideviewElement'];
}
```

**After: Create new class and tag it as `shopware_emotion.component_handler` in your `services.xml`**

```php
class SideviewComponentHandler implements ComponentHandlerInterface
{
    public function supports(Element $element)
    {
        return $element->getComponent()->getType() === 'emotion-component-sideview';
    }

    public function prepare(PrepareDataCollection $collection, Element $element, ShopContextInterface $context)
    {
        // do some prepare logic
    }

    public function handle(ResolvedDataCollection $collection, Element $element, ShopContextInterface $context)
    {
        // do some handle logic and fill data
        $element->getData()->set('key', 'value');
    }
}
```

#### Requesting items in ComponentHandler

To make use of the performance improvement, you have to split your logic into a prepare step and handle step. The prepare step collects product numbers or criteria objects which will be resolved across all elements at once. The handle step provides a collection with resolved products and can be filled into your element.

```php
public function prepare(PrepareDataCollection $collection, Element $element, ShopContextInterface $context)
{
    $productNumber = $element->getConfig()->get('selected_product_number');
    $collection->getBatchRequest()->setProductNumbers('my-unique-request', [$productNumber]);
}

public function handle(ResolvedDataCollection $collection, Element $element, ShopContextInterface $context)
{
    $product = current($collection->getBatchResult()->get('my-unique-request'));
    $element->getData()->set('product', $product);
}
```

Keep in mind to use a unique key for requesting and getting products. For best practise, use the element's id in your key (`$element->getId()`).

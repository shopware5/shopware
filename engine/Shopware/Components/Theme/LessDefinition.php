 * This class is used to implement own less files via plugin.
 * To add plugin less files you can listen to the event

 * the \Shopware\Components\Theme\Compiler.
 * This event is a collection event, which expects that
 * the event listener returns a Doctrine\Common\Collections\ArrayCollection.
 *
 * example:
 * <code>
 *      public function addLessFiles(Enlight_Event_EventArgs $args)
 *      {
 *          $less = new \Shopware\Components\Theme\LessDefinition(
 *              //less configuration variables

 *                  'color1' => '#fff',
 *                  'color2' => '#000'

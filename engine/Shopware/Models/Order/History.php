 * Shopware order history model represents the status history for a single order.
 * If the order or payment status are changed a new entry will be saved in the history.
 * The following data will be saved: The orderID of the changed order, the change date, the previous and current order and payment status,
 * an optional comment which can be set over the backend module and the associated user (optional), if the status
 * has changed from the backend order module.
 *
 * The order history has the following associations:
 * <code>
 *   - Order                    =>  Shopware\Models\Order\Order    [s_order]     bi-directional
 *   - User                     =>  Shopware\Models\User\User      [s_core_auth] uni-directional
 *   - Previous order status    =>  Shopware\Models\Order\Status   [core_states] uni-directional
 *   - Previous payment status  =>  Shopware\Models\Order\Status   [core_states] uni-directional
 *   - Current order status     =>  Shopware\Models\Order\Status   [core_states] uni-directional
 *   - Current payment status   =>  Shopware\Models\Order\Status   [core_states] uni-directional
 * </code>
 *

 * <code>
 *   - PRIMARY KEY (`id`),

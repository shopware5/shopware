<p>One of swipeleft, swiperight, swipeup or swipedown is triggered on moveend, when the move has covered at least a threshold proportion of the dimension of the target node.</p>

<p>Swipe events are a thin wrapper around the moveend event, a convenience to reveal when a finger has made a swipe gesture. As such they don't bubble &mdash; they are retriggered on each passing of a moveend event. The underlying move events do bubble and delegate. Use them if you need more flexibility.</p>

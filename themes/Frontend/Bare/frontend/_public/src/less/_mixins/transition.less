`@param: {String} properties: The properites which should be animated (Default: all)`<br/>
`@param: {String} duration: Duration of the transition including the unit (Default: 0.3s)`<br/>
`@param: {String} easing: The easing which should be used for the transition (Default: ease-out)`

.transition(@transition: all 0.3s ease-out) {
    transition: @transition;
}

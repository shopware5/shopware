### Improved ExtJS auto-loading

Previous to Shopware 5.6, only ExtJS files from the `Shopware.apps.Base` were loaded globally, so you can use them globally in your apps. 
Additional to that, when loading up a module like e.g. "ProductStream", all files from `Shopware.apps.ProductStream` were loaded on top.
Using files from others apps, such as `Shopware.apps.Article` inside of the `Shopware.apps.ProductStream` application, required you to implement some special code in order to do so.
Also, when using an ExtJS store in your plugin configuration, you were only able to use stores from `Shopware.apps.Base`, none of the other stores.

We've improved our auto-loading of ExtJS files, so you don't have to worry about this anymore.
Instead of failing, because you used files of an application, that didn't get loaded yet, we're simply loading the missing application now.
This way you don't have to worry about using others applications files anymore, as well as worrying about which stores can be used
in your plugin configuration.

### Controller Registration using DI-Tag

Controllers can be now registered using the DI tag `shopware.controller`. This DI tag needs attributes `module` and `controller`. These controllers are also lazy-loaded.

#### Example:

##### DI:

```xml
<service id="SwagExample\Controller\Frontend\SwagTest">
    <argument type="service" id="dbal_connection"/>
    <tag name="shopware.controller" module="frontend" controller="swagTest"/>
</service>
```

##### Controller:

```php
<?php

namespace SwagExample\Controller\Frontend;

use Doctrine\DBAL\Connection;

class SwagTest extends \Enlight_Controller_Action
{
    private $connection;

    public function __construct(Connection $connection)
    {
        $this->connection = $connection;
        parent::__construct();
    }

    public function indexAction()
    {
        // Do something with $this->connection
    }
    
    public function detailAction(int $productNumber = null, ListProductServiceInterface $listProductService, ContextServiceInterface $contextService)
    {
        if (!$productNumber) {
            throw new \RuntimeException('No product number provided');
        }
        
        $this->View()->assign('product', $listProductService->getList([$productNumber], $contextService->getShopContext()));
    }
}
```

### Autowire of controller actions parameters

The new controllers tagged with `shopware.controller` tag, can now have parameters in action methods. Possible parameters are

* Services (e.g `ListProductService $listProductService`)
* $request (e.g `Request $request`)
* $requestParameters (e.g `int $limit = 0`, `/action?limit=5`)

### The request and response instances in Shopware now extend from Symfony's Request / Response

`Enlight_Controller_Request_RequestHttp` is now extending `Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\Request` and `Enlight_Controller_Response_ResponseHttp` extends `Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\Response`. This is a first move to switch to Symfony Controllers and Request/Responses completely in a future release. 

### Custom validation of order numbers (SKU)

Up to now, the validation of order numbers (or SKUs) was done in form of a Regex-Assertion in the Doctrine model at `Shopware\Models\Article\Detail::$number`. That solution was not flexible and didn't allow any modifications of said regex, let alone a complete custom implementation of a validation.
 
Now, a new constraint `Shopware\Components\Model\DBAL\Constraints\OrderNumber` is used instead, which is a wrapper around `\Shopware\Components\OrderNumberValidator\RegexOrderNumberValidator`.

This way you can either change the regex which is being used for validation by defining one yourself in the `config.php`:
```php
<?php
return [
    'product' => [
        'orderNumberRegex' => '/^[a-zA-Z0-9-_.]+$/' // This is the default
    ],
    'db' => [...],
]
``` 
Or you can create your own implementation of the underlying interface `Shopware\Components\OrderNumberValidator\OrderNumberValidatorInterface` and use it for the validation by simply decorating the current service with id `shopware.components.ordernumber_validator` and e.g. query some API.

### Definition of MySQL version in config

It is now possible to define the MySQL version being used in the `config.php` as part of the Doctrine default configuration.
The version can be determined by running the SQL query `SELECT version()`, the result needs to be provided in the `db.serverVersion` config:

```php

<?php
return [
     ...
     'db' => [
         ...
         'serverVersion' => '5.7.24',
     ],
];
```
Providing this value via config makes it unnecessary for Doctrine to figure the version out by itself, thus reducing the number of database calls Shopware makes per request by one.

If you are running a MariaDB database, you should suffix the `serverVersion` with `-MariaDB` (e.g.: `10.3.18-MariaDB`).

### Payment Token

Some internet security software packages open a new clean browser without cookies for payments.
After returning from the payment provider, the customer will be redirected to the home page, because the new browser instance does not contain the previous session.
For this reason there is now a service to generate a token, which can be added to the returning url (e.g `/payment_paypal/return?paymentId=test123&swPaymentToken=abc123def`).
This parameter will be resolved in the PreDispatch.
If the user is not logged in, but the URL contains a valid token, he will get back his former session and will be redirected to the original URL, but without the token

Example implementation:

```php
<?php

use \Shopware\Components\Cart\PaymentTokenService;

class MyPaymentController extends Controller {

    public function gatewayAction()
    {
        // Do some payment things
        $token = $this->get(\Shopware\Components\Cart\PaymentTokenService::class)->generate();
        
        $returnParamters = [
            'controller' => 'payment_paypal',
            'action' => 'return',
            PaymentTokenService::TYPE_PAYMENT_TOKEN => $token
        ];
        $returnLink = $this->router->assemble($returnParamters);
        
        $redirectUrl = $this->paymentProviderApi->createPayment($cart, $returnLink);
        
        $this->redirect($redirectUrl);
    }
}
```

### Replaced Codemirror with Ace-Editor

Codemirror has been replaced with Ace-Editor. For compatibility reason, Ace-Editor supports all xtypes / classes from Codemirror.
Following modes are available
    * css
    * html
    * javascript
    * json
    * less
    * mysql
    * php
    * sass
    * scss
    * smarty
    * sql
    * text
    * xml
    * xquery
    
## Improved Robots.txt

robots.txt shows now all links from all language shops.
To remove or add entries overwrite the blocks `frontend_robots_txt_disallows_output`, `frontend_robots_txt_allows_output` and call methods `setAllow`, `setDisallow`, `removeAllow`, `removeDisallow`

Example:

```smarty
{block name="frontend_robots_txt_disallows_output"}
    {$robotsTxt->removeDisallow('/ticket')}
    {$smarty.block.parent}
{/block}
```

### Plugin specific logger

There is a new logger service for each plugin.
The service id is a combination of the plugin's service prefix (lower camel case plugin name) and `.logger`.

For example: when a plugin's name is `SwagPlugin` the specific logger can be accessed via `swag_plugin.logger`.
This logger will now write into the logs directory using a rotating file pattern like the other logger services.

The settings for the logger can be configured using the DI parameters `swag_plugin.logger.level`(defaults to shopware default logging level) and `swag_plugin.logger.max_files` (defaults to 14 like other shopware loggers).
In this case the logger would write into a file like `var/log/swag_plugin_production-2019-03-06.log`.

Support for easier log message writing is enabled:

```php
<?php

$logger->fatal("An error is occured while requesting {module}/{controller}/{action}", $controller->Request()->getParams());
```

### Manual Sorting of products in categories

Products in a category can be now sorted "by hand". This specific sorting can also be created using the categories API resource.

They will be applied when the associated sorting has been selected in the storefront. Not manually sorted products will use the configured normal fallback sorting.

### HTTP2 Server Push Support

HTTP2 Server Push allows Shopware to push certain resources to the browser without it even requesting them. To do so, Shopware creates `Link`-headers for specified resources, informing Apache or Nginx to push these files to the browser. Server Push is supported since [Apache 2.4.18](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/mod_http2.html#h2push) and [nginx 1.13.9](https://www.nginx.com/blog/nginx-1-13-9-http2-server-push/#http2_push).

These resources are only pushed on the very first request of a client. After that, the files should be cached in the browser and don't need to be transmitted anymore. The presence of a `session`-cookie is used to determine if a push is necessary.

The Smarty function `{preload}` is used to define in the template which resource are to be pushed and as what.

Example for CSS:
```html
<link href="{preload file={$stylesheetPath} as="style"}" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" />
```

Example for Javascript:
```html
<script src="{preload file={link file='somefile.js'} as="script"}"></script>
```

Server Push can be enabled in the `Various` section of the `Cache/Performance` settings. Please do not enable Server Push support if you are using Google's Pagespeed module: It creates custom CSS and Javascript files for the browser, replacing the ones Shopware contains in the HTML. So pushing the original files to the browser leads to an unnecessary overhead.

### Improved ExtJs Error Reporter

Extjs error reporter shows now also the server response and lints the code to show errors.

### ExtJs Developer-Mode

ExtJs developer mode loads a developer-version file of ExtJs to provide code documentation, warnings and better error messages. This mode can be enabled using this snippet in the `config.php`

```php
'extjs' => [
    'developer_mode' => true
]
```

### Content Types

Content Types are something similar to attributes, but you can create your own simple entity with defined fields using using xml or the backend.

Example XML:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<contentTypes xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
              xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation="../../../engine/Shopware/Bundle/ContentTypeBundle/Resources/contenttypes.xsd">
    <types>
        <type>
            <typeName>store</typeName>
            <name>Stores</name>
            <fieldSets>
                <fieldSet>
                    <field name="name" type="text">
                        <label>Name</label>
                        <showListing>true</showListing>
                    </field>
                    <field name="address" type="text">
                        <label>Address</label>
                        <showListing>false</showListing>
                    </field>
                    <field name="country" type="text">
                        <label>Country</label>
                        <showListing>false</showListing>
                    </field>
                </fieldSet>
            </fieldSets>
        </type>
    </types>
</contentTypes>
```

Each type gets its own

* backend controller
* frontend controller, if enabled
* API controller for all CRUD operations (Custom**type_name** e.g. CustomStore)
* backend menu icon
* table with `s_custom_` prefix
* repository service with shopware.bundle.content_type.**type_name**

They are also accessible in template using new smarty function `fetchContent`

Example
```html
{fetchContent type=store assign=stores filter=[['property' => 'country', 'value' => 'Germany']]}

{foreach $stores as $store}
    {$store.name}
{/foreach}
```

The backend fields and titles can be translated using snippet namespace ``backend/customYOURTYPE/main``.

You can find more information and details (e.g. regarding available field types) in the [Developer Docs](https://developers.shopware.com/developers-guide/content-types/).

### FQCN as DIC ids

Starting with Shopware 5.6, new services will have their Fully Qualified Class Names (FQCN) as their service id in the DIC.

Classes that implement an interface will normally use that interface as their FQCN, though exemptions may occur if an
interface is implemented multiple times (e.g. the `SubscriberInterface`).

For the moment, all existing legacy service ids will be converted to lowercase and should be used in lowercase in plugins
as well. Since the Shopware DIC is case-insensitive, this is no problem in existing plugins or older Shopware installations.

This change is being made as a first arrangement for a future switch to Symfony 4, where the DIC is case sensitive and
FQCNs are the default.

### Disable logging of specific exceptions

Sometimes you are aware that exceptions occur, but you're not interested in them being logged since there is nothing you
can do about them and their occurring isn't harmful to the system or your business. One example might be a
`CSRFTokenValidationException` being thrown by visiting bots.

To prevent those exceptions from cluttering up your log, you are now able to disable logging of those exceptions. To do so,
add the class name of the exceptions your want to exempt from being logged to your `config.php`:

```php
'errorHandler' => [
    'ignoredExceptionClasses' => [
        \Shopware\Components\CSRFTokenValidationException::class,
        \Shopware\Components\Api\Exception\CustomValidationException::class
    ]
]
```
By default, these exceptions are now longer being logged:
```php
\Shopware\Components\Api\Exception\BatchInterfaceNotImplementedException::class,
\Shopware\Components\Api\Exception\CustomValidationException::class,
\Shopware\Components\Api\Exception\NotFoundException::class,
\Shopware\Components\Api\Exception\OrmException::class,
\Shopware\Components\Api\Exception\ParameterMissingException::class,
\Shopware\Components\Api\Exception\PrivilegeException::class,
\Shopware\Components\Api\Exception\ValidationException::class,
```
